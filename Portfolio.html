            <h4>Utah Department of Corrections</h4>

            <p>I was born in Thousand Oaks, California.  My parents moved us to Bountiful, Utah when I was 4 years old.  After a car crashed into the corner of our house we moved to Orem, Utah.  This is where I grew up.  I attended Orem Suncrest Elementary school, Orem Junior High school, and Mountain View High School.</p>
            <p>After high school I went on an LDS mission to Lansing, Michigan.  I spent 2 years in Michigan, and moved back to Utah in 2003.</p>
            <p>After moving back I enrolledin college and started attending classes to become a firefighter paramedic.  I found out rather quickly that school is very expensive, so I picked up a part time job to try to make ends meet, and continue to pay for school.</p>
            <p>I also found out that if you wanna go on dates you need money.  After that first semester at school I started working full time.  I enjoyed spending money so much that I had to pick up a second job.</p>
